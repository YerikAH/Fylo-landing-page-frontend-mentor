# Front-End Mentor | Fylo landing page

This is a solution to the Fylo landing page. The challenge is from [Front-end Mentor.](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd)

## Developing

### What I learned
Another challenge completed after a long time, during development I learned "framer motion" and a bit about front side testing. The challenge didn't have much to do with JavaScript logic, so it served more to improve my CSS and HTML skills.
### Challenge consists of

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
